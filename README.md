## General info
_Javascript project from Codecademy.com | in Full-Stack Engineer Pro Path_

Context: In this project, youâ€™ll build a message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program. Your program should showcase basic JavaScript syntax and programming concepts.

For this project, I chose to hard-code a mad lib string I found from Google images and then I worked with my 7 year old son to come up with arrays of words for each word type. When run, the program will print the madlib string with random entries included for each prompt.
